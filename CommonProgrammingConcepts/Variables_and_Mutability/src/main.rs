        Like immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change,
        but there are a few differences between constants and variables:
        1. First, you arenâ€™t allowed to use `mut` with constants,
           declare constants using the const keyword instead of the let keyword.
        2. The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression,
           not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.
